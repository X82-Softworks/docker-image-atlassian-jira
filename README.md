# Build the image

```
    git clone https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-image-atlassian-jira
    cd docker-image-atlassian-jira
```

To build a custom jira version of your liking

Jira >= =8.0.1

``` 
    export VERSION=8.0.1
    docker build . -t eugenmayer/jira:# $VERSION --build-args JIRA_VERSION=$VERSION
```

For any version of jira <= 8.0.0, we neeed Java 8

    export VERSION=6.17.1
    docker build . -f Dockerfile_java8 -t eugenmayer/jira:# $VERSION --build-args JIRA_VERSION=$VERSION
    
# Run in debug mode

If you want to run JIRA with a debug port, please see `examples/debug` - esentially what we do is
 - we add the debug port as an env parameter
 - we overwrite the start-jira.sh script so we do not user `catalina.sh run` as startup bun rater `catalina.sh jpda run` .. that is about anything we changed in there
 - we expose the port 5005 to the host so we can connect
